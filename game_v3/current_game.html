          <h3>Important events so far</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>03/28 - <b>(Night 4)</b> Evil kills the Guardian to wipe the entire good team with a single attack. Dark Phoenix rises during the day. All 4 evil members are alive and SK fails to meet the win condition (due to getting blocked twice for his attack on the Guardian) which means that evil has won.</li>
            <li>03/28 - Game is sped up. Actions are forced to be submitted sooner. Too many people are way too invested 5+ hours.</li>
            <li>03/27 - <b>(Night 3)</b> Lots of people are wounded. Tim and Krystal are killed.</li>
            <li>03/25 - Day 3 SK OPTION has been taken: Reveal publicly that you're not in row 4 AND one of your starting roles as not in play in order to gain priority attacks before evil. The Vampire is not in play.</li>
            <li>03/25 - <b>(Night 2)</b> Lots of people are wounded. Vincent, John, Lingke, and Ajay (moderator) are killed.</li>
            <li>03/24 - Day 2 evil OPTION has been taken. 1 random attack on an evil person for 3 non-killing attacks on good.</li>
            <li>03/23 - Day 2 OPTION:
            You may give up your ability to attack for the rest of the game in order to be put into a group chat with a random member of your team. Their role is revealed to you. Fake News (if in play) does not affect this information. If you want to take this option, PM ME some variation of: "I give up my ability to attack for the rest of the game to be introduced to a random member of my team"</li>
            <li>03/23 - <b>(Night 1)</b> Vincent, John, Tony, and Nikita are attacked. Ajay is attacked 6 times, nearing death.</li>
            <li>03/21 - An indisputable report reveals that the Vigilante is locked up (not in play) and the judge reveals that the Clairvoyant is acquitted (not in play). A potentially drunk police officer tells you that row #2 seems most suspicious (has the most number of evil characters of any row). There is a 50% chance the officer is drunk and his information is incorrect. Evil has decided to trade this info for some additional starting info: Vampire Seeker and Scarlet Witch are not in play.</li>
            <li>03/21 - Game begins!</li>

        NOT IN PLAY for SK:

If you were killed by a good character or the Serial Killer, you die aligned with the good.
        ->Mirror - When you are attacked, the attacker also takes a hit.
