## Changelog

Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Version 6 - 03/15/2021

### Added

- New team: Serial Killer (SK) Team (can be used in place of Elementals)
- New characters: Secret Serial Killer, Public Serial Killer, Copycat (good), Sherlock (good), Moriarty (evil)
- New concept of “Team Passives”: Evil can’t be killed on the first night if there are only two evil players; SK Team - if they both decide to attack during the same night, another random player will get attacked as well (free random attack)

### Changed

- No player can be blocked twice in one game
- Any abilities that say “kill in one shot” now say attack twice instead
- Events slightly updated to include SK team
- Mirror cannot reflect dodged damage
- Guardian starts with two bluffs instead of one
- Forensic Scientist’s description has replaced “Serial Killer” with “Secret Serial Killer”
- Public Announcer’s description has replaced “Serial Killer” with “Secret Serial Killer”
- Homunculus updated to include SSK
- Blacksmith’s ability has changed to “Choose a player to receive the Quick Attack ability this night. You cannot choose the same player twice in a row. The player will not be notified of this.”
- Legolas loses the text “Any actions that can kill in one shot will ignore your ability and still pierce you to death” since there are no more “kill shots”
- Hierophant's example updated to remove “Vampire”
- Elementals temporarily put on the backburner for reworking later

### Removed

- Vampire, Vampire Seeker, Vampire Hunter
- “If a Guardian or Shadow Walker has died and the game is not over, there will be an announcement of his death.” SW still gets announced, but Guardian does not in order to protect the SK in rare cases.
